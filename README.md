# PhD Project Repository

Welcome to the repository for my PhD project within the **TClock4AD** doctoral network, on *STRUCTURE AND LIGAND-BASED STRATEGIES TO DISCOVER OREXIN RECEPTOR MODULATORS TARGETING THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK AND AD*.

This repository will serve as a central hub for all code, environments, and models developed by me within project. It is under active development, and content will be added progressively as the research evolves.

## Contents
### üß™ `Environment/`
- Contains the conda environment file used across notebooks and pipelines.
- To set up the environment, run:
  ```bash
  conda env create -f Environment/cchem.yml
  conda activate cchem

### üóÉÔ∏è `Datasets/`
- Datasets of molecules used to develop the virtual screening protocols and ML models be made available via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

### üìä `Analysis/`
- Contains Jupyter notebooks detailing various analysis pipelines.
- Includes `.yml` file for setting up an Anaconda environment.

### ü§ñ `ML_models/`
- Directory for storing trained machine learning models in pickled format (`.pkl`).
